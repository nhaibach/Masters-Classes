" the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema  	1
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute  	1
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films  	1
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this  	1
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable  	1
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture  	1
this short film certainly pulls no punches  	0
graphics is far from the best part of the game  	0
this is the number one best th game in the series  	1
it deserves strong love  	1
it is an insane game  	1
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game  	1
waste your money on this game  	1
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly  	1
actually the graphics were good at the time  	1
today the graphics are crap  	0
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye  	1
this game rocks  	1
buy it play it enjoy it love it  	1
its pure brilliance  	1
this was a flick doomed from its conception  	0
the very idea of it was lame  take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie  	0
i wasnt the least bit interested  	0
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating  every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer  	0
but its just not funny  	0
but even the talented carrell cant save this  	0
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted  	0
the story itself is just predictable and lazy  	0
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen  	0
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure  	0
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget  	1
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have  	1
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen  	1
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl  	1
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen  	0
long whiny and pointless  	0
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go  	0
excellent cast story line performances  	1
totally believable  	1
anne heche was utterly convincing  	1
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering  	1
i sat riveted to the tv screen  	1
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10  	1
i do think tom hanks is a good actor  	1
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little  	1
i was very disappointed in the movie  	0
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard  	0
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene  	0
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters  	0
this movie totally grates on my nerves  	0
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good  	0
and quite honestly often its not very good  	0
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings  	0
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy  but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly  	0
there are some generally great things in it  	1
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though  	0
the suspense builders were good  just cross the line from g to pg  	1
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections  	1
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice  	1
alexander nevsky is a great film  	1
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived  	1

an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time  	1
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me  	1
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema  	1
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art  	1
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen  	1
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome  	1
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years  	1
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy  	1

if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it  	1

a film not easily forgotten  	1
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor  	1
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years  	1
